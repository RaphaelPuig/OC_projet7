Unzip and cut/paste the folders in your directory.

To locally run the dashboard and predictor apps:
1. create and activate a virtual environment (e.g. via virtualenv)
2. install the required libraries: $ pip install -r requirements.txt
3. run the app: $ python [name_of_app].py

To locally run the final application:
1. change directory to puigraphael-oc-projet7_dev folder
2. create a virtual environment and install required libraries (see above)
3. run the app: $ python index.py

The final application is also deployed at the following URL: https://puigraphael-oc-projet7.herokuapp.com/
